# CompanyViabilityClassifier

## Overview
This project aims to predict the health status of companies (healthy or bankrupt) using various machine learning classification techniques. Given the challenge of working with an unbalanced dataset, this project explores the effectiveness of different models and techniques in accurately classifying companies based on their financial indicators.

## Dataset
The dataset includes financial indicators of various companies over multiple years. Due to privacy and confidentiality, the dataset is not publicly available and is stored on Google Drive for project use.

## Models Used
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)

## Metrics
The models are evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC score to determine their effectiveness in predicting company health.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab (for accessing the dataset stored on Google Drive)

## Contributing
This project was developed by a team of students as part of a machine learning coursework. Contributions, suggestions, and improvements are welcome.
